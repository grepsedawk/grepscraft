World of Warcraft just announced they're changing the auction house significantly.

This is the first major change of the auction house and it breaks a lot of current
strategy, such as pretty stacking and possibly even over-cutting specific stack sizes!

It's too early to say for sure, but my initial opinion is that this will greatly
affect each type of player very differently when it comes to gold-making,
greatly reducing the middle class whilst greatly increasing the lower and upper
class' ability to make gold on the auction house.

## What's Changing?

The blizzard auction house is changing, and it's a huge change. This change breaks
more than just add-ons this time around. The biggest change is within the UI,
and while it appears cosmetic it is actually far more in depth.

### Stacks

They completely, totally removed stacks.

You simply list x qty at x price.

For instance, my previous operations for materials were laid out like this:

Stack Size | Stack Qty
---|---
200|10
100|10
50|10
20|20 _*_
10_**_|10

_* Increased for various world contributions_

_** Partial stacks allowed, so you don't end up with orphan stacks_

This totals out to 4000 total listed product.

In the new system, this would simply be listed at "a quantity of 4,000". The new
auction house removed stacks. When you want to buy, you simply enter the quantity
you want to buy, the auction house _automatically_ selects the cheapest auctions
and then you see a grand total to choose to purchase the selected items.

### Mailbox

Items that are the same, and the same price that were bought or expired at the same time will now be grouped together.

This will save a huge amount of time when it comes to mailboxes for people that
list a lot of the same materials!

### Favorites

With the addition of favorites, you can now instantly scan for the lowest
priced auctions in 1 WoW API call. This means that to scan my previous materials scan on
