World of Warcraft just announced they're changing the auction house significantly.

This is the first major change of the auction house and it breaks a lot of current
strategy, such as pretty stacking and possibly even over-cutting specific stack sizes!

I think this change will affect each type of player very differently when it comes
to gold-making, greatly reducing the middle class whilst greatly increasing the
lower and upper class.
